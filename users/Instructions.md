# To download the mp3 files correctly, follow these instructions :
- Download Forroset
- Create a folder to store the mp3 files, this folder cannot contain other files.
- Use the function getMusics(forroset,mp3folder)
   - The first parameter must be a string containing the path to the forroset csv file
    - The second parameter must be a string containing the path to the destination folder of the mp3 files
- Some files may not download automatically
  - A list containing their download links and their unique identifiers will be printed at the end of the code execution
   - Access the provided urls and download the files manually
   - To avoid identification problems, rename the downloaded files to their unique identifiers provided
